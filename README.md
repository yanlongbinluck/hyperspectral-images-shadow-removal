# hyperspectral-images-shadow-removal
Our code is based on [PyTorch-GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN), many thanks for this great work.

The model is trained with torch1.1 and cuda10.0. The all training data and reconstruction results can be found [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lDw_fxtwKDaayNrV1z3YXA) (password:fzfl).
